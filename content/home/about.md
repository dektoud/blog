# Biography {#bio}

I am a geologist turned geostatistician who loves to develop innovative solutions for geostatistical and geological modeling problems. My PhD thesis revolved around several data-driven solutions that address complex and important components of a geostatistical modeling workflow, with the goal of reducing subjectivity and increasing reproducibility between practitioners. My tool of choice is Python.

After obtaining my MSc at the University of Waterloo in 2012, I worked as an exploration geologist in northern Ontario at a syenite-hosted gold deposit. In 2014 I began at Center for Computational Geostatistics at the University of Alberta, and obtained my PhD in Geostatistics in early 2019.

I have worked in several research areas including: locally varying anisotropy (LVA), LVA parameter inference, LVA field modeling, high-performance computing (HPC), Python library development, implicit boundary modeling, clustering and spatial clustering, local change of support, and estimation and simulation methodologies for recoverable reserves. I have a keen interest in geochemistry, mineral chemistry, spatial clustering, implicit modeling, locally varying anisotropy and other non-stationary geostatistical topics.
