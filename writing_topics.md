# Writing Projects:

## Geostatistics 

- Decision making theory
- Anisotropy and rotations, GSLIB and beyond
- radial basis functions, implementations and comparison to kriging
- Non-stationarity from a practial standpoint
- The place of clustering and geostatistical clustering in geostatstical workflows
- How does LU simulation work, conditional + random stuff

## Geology

- MSc project
- processing geochemical data files
- summarizing geochemical data with principle component analyses

## Programming

- ~~tangible methods to write fast subroutines for python ***without*** being a computer scientist~~
- A simple intro to designing a Qt GUI
- ~~how f2py speeds up my workflow~~??
- pygeostat, f2py, and geostatistical programming
- writing Paraview XML files
- Paraview scripting - because 3D plotting in python sucks
- Everyone new to python should know about [Christopher Gohlke's Website](http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/)
    - particularly if you are a windows user and the package you want to install involves compiling some C or fortran extensions.... this causes lots of frustration
