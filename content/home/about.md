# Biography {#bio}

Ryan Martin is a PhD student at the University of Alberta studying Geostatistics for uncertainty characterizations in natural systems. Following his MSc he worked as an exploration geologist in northern Ontario at a syenite-hosted gold deposit. He has keen interest in geochemistry, mineral chemistry, clustering, spatial clustering, locally varying anisotropy and other non-stationary geostatistical topics. 

Ryan is a self-taught programmer who enjoys the `art` of Fortran. He excels at creating mildly inefficient research code that accomplishes a variety of tasks. Of special interest, Ryan enjoys compiling and testing various libraries; sparse solvers, binary storage, parallel computing, etc, developing python code for [pygeostat](ccgalberta.com/pygeostat), writing research papers, geeking out over computers and components and [CS:GO](http://blog.counter-strike.net/).
