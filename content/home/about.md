# Biography

Ryan Martin is a PhD student at the University of Alberta studying Geostatistics for uncertainty characterizations in natural systems. Following his MSc he worked as an exploration geologist in northern Ontario at a syenite-hosted gold deposit. He has keen interest in geochemistry, mineral chemistry, clustering, spatial clustering, locally varying anisotropy and other non-stationary geostatistical topics.
